A simple app that converts HTML to JSON and back. This is effective for utilization of a virtual dom like an app such as a website builder.

### Version
0.0.1

### Tech

html2json uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Pico.css](https://picocss.com/) - Pico.css is a minimal css framework for semantic html (used for the app's UI)
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A low-level CSS framework that's entirely utility-first and provides users with low-level CSS classes in PostCSS that can be used to define components and designs independently.
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - a font and icon toolkit
* [FileSaver.js](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js/) - Client-side solution for saving files
